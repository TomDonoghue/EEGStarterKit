# EEGTemplates

A template and starter kit for doing EEG analysis in Python.

## Overview

This repo (in development) will serve as a template / starter kit for running EEG analysis, in particular outlining the style and structure of EEG analysis projects done at the [VoytekLab](https://github.com/voytekresearch/).

This repository / template is not a tutorial or guide, but more of a template structure, of how to organize an EEG analysis, if you already know the steps that you want to take.

Note that if you want to get started working with EEG data, a list of open data is available [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenData), and a broader list of available software tools for working with such data is available [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenTools).

## Requirements

This template expects that you are with using Python3, with the [Anaconda distribution], as well as [MNE](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python), and any related tools / extras you might want to use, such as [AutoReject](https://github.com/autoreject/autoreject).

## Examples

ToDo.
