# EEGStarterKit

A template and starter kit EEG analysis in Python.

## Overview

This repo (in development) will serve as a template / starter kit for running EEG analysis, in particular in the style / with the approaches that we use at the [VoytekLab](https://github.com/voytekresearch/).

This repository / template is not a tutorial or guide, per se, though it may hopefully collect and link out to useful resources for the type of analyses most related to using this template.

Note that if you want to get started working with EEG data, a list of open data is available [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenData), and a broader list of available software tools for working with such data is available [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenTools).

## Requirements

This template expects that you are with using Python3, with the [Anaconda distribution], as well as [MNE](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python), and any related tools / extras you might want to use, such as [AutoReject](https://github.com/autoreject/autoreject).

## Examples

ToDo.
